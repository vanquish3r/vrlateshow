Kitty Opening

Before we start, can we talk about these microphones? 

Someone mentioned the other day that the microphone is very phallic, and honestly… they weren’t wrong. Who designed these things? They look less like microphones and more like Hitachi magic wands wearing Bob Ross wigs. I’m looking at it thinking, “Is it about to teach me painting or give me happy little orgasms?”

And it demands attention. I pick it up, and I half-expect it to whisper, “Ready to bring joy to the masses, love?” I’m supposed to tell jokes while this thing is silently judging me for every pun.

Sometimes I imagine it coaching me. I flub a line, and it tilts like a headshake: “Try again, hon. You can do better.” And the audience is sitting there like, “Are we laughing at her… or that mic?”
---
And then I start picturing it getting interactive. What if, mid-joke, it vibrates slightly? Is it keeping me on pace… or giving a tutorial on happy little orgasms? Should I start naming it? Margaret? Susan? Something soothing, but very authoritative.

I even imagine the audience joining in. “Point at the mic when you hear a pun and pretend it’s giving you life advice. No, no, focus on the Bob Ross wig—it’s telling you to embrace your happy little mistakes.”

And really… the possibilities are endless. Microphone, Hitachi wand, life coach. All three at once, delivering art, sound… and extremely personal wellness tips. I just hope it doesn’t start painting on the walls while I’m trying to make a joke.

So if I seem slightly distracted tonight… don’t worry. I’m not nervous. I’m negotiating with a microphone that looks like it could give a TED Talk and a very specific tutorial on pleasure at the same time.

---
Anyway, I guess that’s what I get for opening my own show. Nobody else wanted to be the one holding the electric paintbrush of shame.

Kind of like working for my boss. You think you’re walking into a normal shift, ready to do your thing… and then you realize you’ve volunteered to hold the chaos wand. And trust me, the lessons he teaches are very hands-on.

You ever work for someone who thinks they know everything but somehow manages to mess up literally everything they touch? That’s my boss. Every shift with him feels like an interactive tutorial on “How Not to Restaurant.”

One day he’s talking to me, trying to look all in charge, and mid-sentence he drops actual silverware straight into a takeout bag. Like full-on fork, knife, spoon. I’m watching it happen like, “Ah yes, nothing says ‘to-go order’ like cutlery that could stab a small child.”
---
I tell him, “You just put silverware in that bag.”
He looks at me completely serious and says, “No, I didn’t.”
Buddy… it’s clinking. The bag sounds like a wind chime in a hurricane.

Later he tells me to pack up the drive-thru orders, so I grab all the food and all the chits. He immediately goes, “If you were gonna do that, I would’ve bagged it myself. You’re confusing me. You’re going to get confused.”

I look him dead in the eyes and say, “I’m not confused.” Then I walk away like I just solved world peace… for about four seconds until he forgets to put a sandwich on an order.
---
He slows everyone down so bad ticket times double, he forgets stuff on plates, forgets items in takeout bags. And when people call back to complain, he’s all, “I don’t know how that happened.”
Yeah you do, Sherlock. You happened.

So yeah, if you ever wonder how the food comes out wrong… just remember, it’s not you. It’s him. And somehow we all survive to serve another order.

---
You ever have a customer that just… exists to ruin your day? I had this one, let’s call her Methany, because the vibes were strong. She was a semi-regular, always weird, always dramatic. One day she comes in, gets her order, leaves, and then comes back swearing we forgot part of it.

I bagged that order myself. I checked off every single item on the receipt as I packed it. I know damn well nothing was missing. But Methany was convinced I was running some kind of restaurant conspiracy.

So I go to the back to “view the footage,” which, in my world, meant calling the police, because she’s yelling, throwing things, and some other idiot customer decided they were going to defend her… like I needed backup from the peanut gallery.

Methany starts grabbing stuff off the counter and hurling it, threatening to call the police on us. I just calmly tell her, “Yeah, the police are on their way, by the way.” She disappears. For a few days. I think, finally, peace.
---
Then she comes back to “apologize.” Turns out she found the missing item… on the floor of her car.

I never served her again. And honestly, she was just the cherry on top of the daily chaos sundae. Between a boss who forgets sandwiches, puts silverware in takeout bags, and customers who think screaming makes food taste better, Methany was basically a training exercise in human insanity.

And the best part? You earned your survival badge. You earned your emergency chocolate ration. Congratulations, you leveled up in human chaos… and unlocked the “Why am I still here?” achievement.

---
Before we wrap up, quick announcement—I need some opening acts for this show. I know, I know… shocking, right? The idea that anyone else might want to talk into one of these… questionable microphones.

See, I started opening my own show because nobody else wanted to do the first fifteen minutes of chaos and warm the audience up for me. But now I’m realizing something: there’s already enough of me on stage. Do you really want more me? No. You do not. You don’t want me talking to myself for fifteen minutes while you stare at me wondering why your life choices brought you here.

So here’s the deal. If you’d like to open, now’s your chance. I don’t care if you’ve never done comedy before, if you like talking into something that looks like it could whisper “happy little orgasms,” or if you just want to see how terrifying it is to have the audience look at you like you’re the weirdo… this is your shot.
---
Reach out. Seriously. Slide into my DMs, send a smoke signal, tie a note to a pigeon. Come open for the show. Give the people a warm-up act, give me a break, and most importantly… give me the joy of watching someone else flub jokes while I sip quietly and nod.

Oh, and don’t worry about experience. Don’t worry about nerves. Don’t worry about whether you’re funny. If you can talk into this thing without crying, you’re hired. And if you do cry… bonus points. Tears are comedy gold.

Think about it. This is your moment. Your chance to take the stage, look at that wigged Hitachi, and either slay or fail spectacularly. Either way, we’ll all have a story to tell.

So yeah. Opening acts. Fifteen minutes. Chaos. Microphones that judge you silently. Reach out. Step up. Take the mic. Make mistakes. Embrace the madness. And maybe, just maybe, earn the survival badge.

---
So that’s my time tonight, everyone. Thank you for laughing, surviving, and generally not throwing anything at me… unlike Methany.

And remember, if you ever feel judged, watched, or slightly confused… just know somewhere nearby, there’s a microphone that looks like a Hitachi wand wearing a Bob Ross wig, silently coaching you through life and whispering, “Make love to the canvas, honey.”

Keep your sandwiches in the bag, your silverware in the drawer, and your happy little accidents strictly on the canvas.

I'll be right back to host the show!

Darwin Award

(Pennsylvania) My husband worked at a small, busy rural pharmacy. His customers were hard-working, simple people. Early one morning he dispensed a prescription to the mother of a teenager for anti-nausea tablets and suppositories, labeled with what he thought were clear directions.
Early that evening he received a phone call from the child's mother, asking when the medications would take effect. Knowing that the suppository should have taken effect within an hour, he asked which form of the medicine she had given the child. The mother said she had tried both tablets and suppositories, but the patient was still experiencing severe nausea.

Since the child was evidently sicker than originally diagnosed, my husband told her that she needed to call the doctor and ask for further instructions. Then the mother asked the key question. Should she have unwrapped the suppository before her child swallowed it?

That winner was quickly followed by her inquiry as to how far she should have inserted the tablet rectally, or rather should it have been inserted vaginally? To this day, my husband includes directions for unwrapping suppositories before use, as well as stating that tablets should be taken by mouth!

Top Ten Things We Learned from Taylor Swift’s “The Life of a Showgirl”

Alright, so… I think we can all agree Taylor Swift doesn’t release albums anymore. She drops full-blown cultural earthquakes. Like, The Life of a Showgirl wasn’t an album launch — it was a glitter-coated world takeover with choreography and a body count.

You had Swifties sobbing in theatres, dancing in the aisles, emotionally imploding in surround sound. The popcorn was crying.

And just when we thought we’d recovered from The Tortured Poets Department, she shows up in sequins, holding a microphone like it owes her money, and says, “Let’s go again.”

So in honour of her new era, here are the Top Ten Things We Learned from Taylor Swift’s The Life of a Showgirl.
---

10. Every Swiftie who heard The Life of a Showgirl immediately filed for emotional damages and then bought the vinyl twice.

9. Taylor said The Life of a Showgirl was about empowerment and performance, but the subtext says “I own your streaming service, your boyfriend, and your emotional stability.”

8. Spotify crashed for a full hour after release. Even the algorithm needed a cold shower.

7. Dutch said Wood is his favourite song. So either he’s a deep romantic soul... or he just really appreciates a solid football reference. Either way, that man’s got taste and probably a Chiefs jersey he’s not telling us about.

6. The album sold faster than concert tickets at a Swiftie convention. By the time you finished saying “preorder,” your bank account was already in therapy and your cat was wearing sequins.

5. One reviewer said listening to The Life of a Showgirl felt like being seduced, dumped, and spiritually reborn in a feathered bodysuit.
---
4. Critics called it “her most theatrical era yet,” which is code for “she’s about to make Broadway look like a school play.” Honestly, if this woman ever writes a musical, we’re all just extras.

3. Swifties treated it like the Super Bowl, except this time they actually liked the halftime show.

2. Every song feels like it was written in a mirror while whispering “you messed with the wrong showgirl.” Even the sad ballads sound like they’d sue you in heels. 

1. And the biggest thing we learned? When Taylor writes about “tight ends,” she’s not talking about harmonies.
---
Bonus "runner up" Wood references

5. The song Wood dropped, and suddenly Dutch announced it was his favourite. Guess he’s really into… football metaphors.

4. When asked if Wood was about Travis Kelce, Taylor just smiled like she’d just won the AFC Championship.

3. The track Wood dropped, and immediately, the entire internet went quiet for five seconds, mostly to Google if that title was symbolic. Spoiler: it wasn’t.

2. The song Wood went number one faster than Travis Kelce could say, “Wait, am I in this one?”

1. And the real reason Dutch loves Wood? Because it’s the only song where Taylor sings about football and makes it sound like foreplay.

---
So, yeah. The Life of a Showgirl — part confessional, part revenge fantasy, and part NFL documentary.

If Taylor keeps this up, the next era’s just gonna be called The Life of a Goddess Who’s Tired of Mortals.

And honestly… I’ll still stream it. Twice. On repeat. In heels.

And Dutch? Buddy? We heard you loud and clear. Wood forever, man. Wood forever.

Are You Me?! 

Scenarios 

You’re trying to flirt but your sarcasm keeps getting in the way.

You just realised you left your mic on while talking to yourself about someone who annoyed you five minutes ago.

You’re trying to convince the audience that your snack choice is a gourmet meal.

You just walked into a VR event and immediately forgot what you were supposed to say, so you just start roasting the audience instead.

You’re arguing with tech support while pretending you totally know what a “driver update” is.

You’re trying to be inspirational, but your snack keeps crunching louder than your thoughts.
