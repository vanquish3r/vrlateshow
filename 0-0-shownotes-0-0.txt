History Of Cinema

    •    The first public motion picture screening took place in Paris on December 28, 1895, presented by the Lumière brothers, Auguste and Louis. They showed several short films at the Salon Indien du Grand Café, marking the birth of commercial cinema.

    •    The first comedy film ever made is generally considered to be L’Arroseur Arrosé (The Sprinkler Sprinkled), created in 1895 by the Lumière brothers in France.

   •    The first horror movie, Le Manoir du Diable (The House of the Devil), was made in 1896 by French filmmaker Georges Méliès. Lasting about three minutes, it features the Devil, ghosts, and skeletons, using early special effects like smoke, traps, and jump cuts. It’s considered the first film to use supernatural themes, marking the birth of the horror genre.

Darwin Award

Tonight’s almost-winner comes to us from Russia, where one man decided that gravity was just a suggestion.

In 2020, an amateur filmmaker was determined to go viral. He didn’t want to film just any YouTube stunt. No, no. He wanted to be the next Elon Musk… if Elon Musk had absolutely no grasp of physics or self-preservation. So, he built what he proudly called his “rocket chair.”

Picture this: a metal lawn chair, some duct tape, and several large homemade fireworks strapped to the bottom. He looked at that death trap and thought, “Yep. That’s flight-worthy.” His friends, instead of talking him out of it, grabbed their phones and hit record, because obviously, this was going to be legendary.

He sits down, gives the camera a thumbs up, and starts his countdown like a budget version of NASA. Three… two… one… ignition.

And instantly, everything goes wrong.
---
Instead of launching gracefully toward the heavens, his “rocket” explodes in a fiery burst of confusion. The fireworks shoot in every direction—sideways, backward, even through the chair legs. Sparks catch his pants on fire, the chair tips over, and the poor guy suddenly finds himself rolling around the backyard like a flaming tumbleweed while his friends are cry-laughing behind the camera.

It’s chaos. There’s smoke, screaming, someone yelling “Put him out!” while another guy is still filming in portrait mode. The rocket chair’s on fire, his eyebrows are gone, and he’s just learned what the word “combustible” really means.

And somehow, he survives. Minor burns, a bruised ego, and a lifetime ban from using fireworks. The video, of course, makes it online under the title “Don’t Try This at Home.”

So tonight, we salute you, Rocket Man. You reached for the stars… and barely made it past the barbecue.

You didn’t win the Darwin Award, but you came close enough to smell the ozone.

Things I Love About Video Games

    •    Video games with tons of loading screens
    •    Games that remove a great feature from the first game and replace it with something worse in the sequel
    •    Paying for a game and then having to buy DLC or other add-ons
    •    Games asking for your opinion, then doing the opposite
    •    Game companies pushing out unfinished games while claiming “work in progress”
    •    Games with great stories but terrible endings
    •    Paying extra for skins
    •    Having to reload repeatedly because of crashes
    •    Crashing at the end of a boss fight
